Lung
cancer
remains
one
the
most
prevalent
and
deadly
forms
cancer
worldwide
with
high
mortality
rate
and
limited
treatment
options
available
Traditional
chemotherapy
and
radiation
therapy
have
been
the
mainstays
lung
cancer
treatment
but
their
efficacy
often
limited
systemic
toxicity
and
drug
resistance
Recently
many
nanoparticles
have
been
identified
and
created
for
drug
delivery
with
the
ability
specifically
target
tumor
cells
while
sparing
healthy
cells
organs
The
nanoparticle
based
drug
delivery
system
offers
distinct
benefits
over
conventional
medication
delivery
including
increased
permeability
and

effect
precision
targeting
and
improved

and

Therefore
this
paper
proposes
the

select
the

Firstly
this
paper
proposes
linguistic

fuzzy
Yager
power
weighted
geometric

operator
for
aggregating
the
linguistic

This
paper
also
demonstrates
several
features
the
proposed

Moreover
using
the
proposed
operator
this
paper
presents
the

making
approach
Furthermore
case

presented
for
the
selection
optimal
nanoparticle

for
the
treatment
lung
cancer
demonstrate
the
proposed
decision
making
approach
applicability
Finally
this
paper
presents
comparison

and
superiority
proposed
decision
making
approach
with
the
other
existing
decision
making
methods
validate
the
proposed
