Time
series
forecasting
prediction
and
estimation
have
been
active
research
topics
recent
years
due
their
critical
role
decision
making
and
future
planning
Artificial
neural
networks
ANNs
are
widely
employed
for
forecasting
applications
and
have
demonstrated
significant
performance
improvements
this
paper
utilize
specialized
type
ANN
the
dendritic
neuron
model
DNM
for
time
series
forecasting
apply
optimized
DNM
model
utilizing
the
power
metaheuristic
optimization
algorithms
Specifically
employ
algorithm
the
mountain
gazelle
optimizer
MGO
optimize
the
parameters
the
DNM
improve
its
configuration
process
and
ultimately
improve
the
accuracy
the
forecast
Furthermore
compare
MGO
performance
with
several
other
optimization
algorithms
used
optimize
the
DNM
model
Comprehensive
evaluations
are
conducted
four
publicly
available
time
series
datasets
using
multiple
evaluation
indicators
The
results
demonstrate
the
superiority
the
MGO
DNM
model
over
competing
methods
with
optimized
DNM
configurations
consistently
outperforming
the
traditional
DNM
forecasting
tasks
