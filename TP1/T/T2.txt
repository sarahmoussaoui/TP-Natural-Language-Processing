Stridulating
insects
like
ants
use
acoustic
communication
crucial
part
their
social
behavior
allowing
them
coordinate
their
activities
and
respond
changing
environmental
conditions
This
paper
introduces
novel
local

based
approach
inspired

Despite

new

Sound

could
provide
better

potentially
improve
