Diagnosing
gastric
diseases
must
address
skewed
medical
data
where
positive
cases
any
specific
gastric
disease
constitute
only
small
proportion
all
cases
due
the
variety
gastric
diseases
Therefore
new
approach
called
for
effectively
diagnose
multiple
gastric
diseases
with
high
scalability
this
study
skewed
medical
data
oriented
parallel
modular
diagnosis
approach
proposed
for
gastric
diseases
via
scalable
belief
ruled
hierarchy
First
analytical
lower
middle
factors
integration
functions
are
constructed
Then
middle
top
diagnosis
model
constructed
using
belief
ruled
hierarchy
Third
skewed
data
oriented
optimization
model
constructed
followed
optimization
algorithm
Finally
parallel
modular
diagnosis
mechanism
proposed
for
multiple
gastric
diseases
practical
case
with
cases
and
nine
types
gastric
diseases
gathered
from
tertiary
hospital
Hangzhou
China
during
three
month
period
studied
for
validation
Case
study
results
demonstrate
that
the
proposed
approach
diagnoses
positive
cases
nine
gastric
diseases
with
average
accuracy
Compared
with
five
other
conditions
with
varied
parameter
configurations
and
four
machine
learning
approaches
the
proposed
approach
produces
optimal
results
and
BPNN
SVM
and
GPR
respectively
owing
its
penalty
coefficient
customized
the
skewed
gastric
data
balance
all
case
diagnosis
accuracy
and
positive
case
accuracy
