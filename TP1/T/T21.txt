The
novelties
include
the
integration

The
contribution
lies
the
development
two
novel

mechanisms
three
new

and
advanced
extraction
strategies
for
the

and
the

The
final
stage
the

presents
novel
scheme
for
the

For
validation
purposes
the
performances
the
proposed
hybrid

algorithm
are
compared
with
five
other
powerful
optimization
algorithms
Eight
standard

functions
and
three
actual

problem
functions
are
employed
here
for
the
evaluation
the
proposed

The
suggested
composite

yielded
the
lowest

NPC
and
LPSP
The

made
and

are
and
respectively
Validation
the
suggested

has
been
further
carried
out
conducting
statistical

The
proposed
