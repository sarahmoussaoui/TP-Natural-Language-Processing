Large
scale
mechanical
fault
detection
plays
critical
role
industrial
production
and
neural
networks
have
been
widely
adopted
for
this
task
However
the
performance
neural
networks
heavily
depends
the
optimization
their
architecture
and
parameters
Traditional
optimization
methods
such
gradient
descent
and
particle
swarm
optimization
can
improve
model
performance
some
extent
but
they
typically
require
adjusting
all
weights
which
not
only
increases
computational
complexity
but
also
often
leads
redundant
network
structures
address
these
challenges
this
paper
proposes
cooperative
neuroevolution
algorithm
for
constructing
lightweight
neural
networks
tailored
for
fault
diagnosis
tasks
The
algorithm
introduces
two
evolving
populations
one
dedicated
learning
the
critical
weights
the
neural
network
and
the
other
focused
optimizing
the
precise
weight
values
This
approach
enables
the
discovery
sparsely
connected
lightweight
neural
network
decoupling
and
cooperatively
optimizing
network
structure
and
weights
the
algorithm
can
more
efficiently
explore
the

space
identify
models
that
are
both
compact

extensive

are
conducted
multiple
industrial

involving

The
results
demonstrate
that
the
algorithm
maintains
high
diagnostic
accuracy
while
significantly
reducing
the

Compared
conventional

exhibits
