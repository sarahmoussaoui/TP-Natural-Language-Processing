This
paper
proposes
novel
variants
the
shuffled
particle
swarm

SPSO
algorithm
for
solving
the
frequency

FMSPI
problem
the
SPSO
framework
the
population
divided
into
several
parallel
groups
and
each
group
undergoes
independent
evolutionary
process
using
particle
swarm

PSO
This
study
employs
two
distinct
strategies
achieve
improved
balance
between
the
exploration
and
exploitation
capabilities
the
SPSO
algorithm
First
introduces
group
specific
strategy
for
the
inertia
weight
factor
parameter
which
dynamically
adjusted
for
each
group
during
every
iteration
the
SPSO
algorithm
Second
facilitate

incorporated
into

Experimental
results
FMSPI
problems
demonstrate
that
the
proposed
strategies
significantly
enhance
the
performance
the
SPSO
algorithm
Also
order
