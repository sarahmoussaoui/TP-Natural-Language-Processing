The
study
urban
satellite
imagery
has
undergone
significant
transformation
due
the
emergence
deep
learning
techniques
This
survey
thoroughly
examines
current
progress
deep
learning
models
designed
for
three
primary
tasks
classification
segmentation
and
change
detection
urban
environments
total
reviewed
studies
were
analyzed
including
convolutional
neural
networks
CNNs
hybrid
models
and
transformer
based
models
such
ResNet
UNet
HRNet
Net
TransCFCCNN
and
STCD
UNet
Prominent
datasets
such
EuroSAT
Merced
SpaceNet
DeepGlobe
LEVIR
and
xBD
were
examined
alongside
performance
metrics
like
accuracy
score
IoU
precision
and
recall
with
results
visualized
through
comparative
bar
plots
Our
comparison
analysis
indicates
that
models
such
GoogleNet
EfficientNet
and
MaxViT
achieve
classification
accuracies
over
while
segmentation
models
like
and
Net
exhibit
IoU
scores
over
STCD
UNet
achieves
exceptional
scores
for
change
detection
These
models
are
crucial
for
urban
development
and
environmental
change
monitoring
facilitating
the

This
study
defines
growing
trends
and
challenges
incorporating

additionally
suggests
future
directions
including
the
use
Mamba
