This

proposes
novel

traditional
Vehicle

Problem
introducing
the
Dynamic

Problem
with

This
new

incorporates

The
algorithm
adapts

This
mechanism
effectively
exploits
past

and
explores
high

for

with
strict

Our
proposed
algorithm
validated
through
extensive
experimental
scenarios
that
simulate
various
spatial
distributions
and
time
sensitive
demands
Results
show
that
our
method
produced
high

and

particularly
complex
environments
with
random

and
