Cooperative
multi
population
social
group
optimization
for
many
objective
optimization
This
study
provides
effective
cooperative
multi
populations
swarm
intelligence
approach
called
CMPMO
SGO
which
based
the
Social
Group
Optimization
SGO
algorithm
address
multi
many
objective
optimization
problems
particular
this
study
first
puts
forth
unique
cooperative
multi
population
framework
namely
CMPMO
des
with
dual
elite
selection
CMPMO
des
achieves
significantly
high
performance
solutions
convergence
and
diversity
with
four
excellent
strategies
the
ability
independently
optimize
one
objective
within
each
subpopulation
collaboration
among
subpopulations
via
global
archive
dual
elite
selection
mechanisms
and
the
inclusion
logistic
chaotic
single
dimensional
perturbation
Afterward
due
its
very
high
performance
SGO
employed
the
single
objective
optimizer
each
subpopulation
Sixteen
state
the
art
multi
many
objective
optimization
algorithms
two
CMPMO
des
based
many
objective
genetic
algorithms
named
CMPMO
and
many
objective
Harris
Hawks
optimization
named
CMPMO
HHO
were
extensively
compared
with
the
performance
CMPMO
SGO
multi
objective
and
many
objective
benchmark
problems
The
results
demonstrate
that
CMPMO
SGO
provides
promising
performance
addressing
multi
many
objective
optimization
problems
utilizing
the
CMPMO
des
framework
