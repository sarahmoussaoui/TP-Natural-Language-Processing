This
work
proposes
the
structuring
dataset
using
real
measurements
current
voltage
curves
from
solar
plant
Based
this
two
classifications
were
performed
detect
shading
and
soiling
modules
Two
different
methods
were
used
for
feature
processing
One
dataset
was
created
using
complete
curves
while
the
other
relied
solely
key
parameters
from
characteristic
curve
The
dataset
used
incorporates
data
current
voltage
irradiance
and
module
temperature
the

measurements
Different
machine

models
were
compared
achieving
