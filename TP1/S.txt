Addressing these challenges requires advanced decision-making frameworks to navigate the complexities of competing factors and uncertainties in plastic waste management (PWM).
This study presents a pioneering decision-making framework tailored to the linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy (\(L^{q}ROF\)) environment, offering enhanced capabilities for handling imprecision and uncertainty.
A key innovation of this work is the introduction of new operational laws for\(L^{q}ROF\)values, grounded in Archimedean copula and co-copula (ACC) theory.

By integrating these AOs with the method based on the removal effects of criteria (MEREC) weighting technique, we propose a comprehensive decision-making approach for identifying optimal PWM strategies.
The robustness and applicability of the framework are demonstrated through a detailed case study, sensitivity analysis, and comparative evaluation, highlighting its effectiveness in delivering reliable and insightful decisions for PWM challenges.
This study provides an effective cooperative multi-populations swarm intelligence approach, called CMPMO-SGO, which is based on the Social Group Optimization (SGO) algorithm to address multi-/many-objective optimization problems.
In particular, this study first puts forth a unique cooperative multi-population framework- namely CMPMO/des, with dual elite selection.
CMPMO/des achieves significantly high performance on solutions convergence and diversity with four excellent strategies: the ability to independently optimize one objective within each subpopulation, collaboration among subpopulations via a global archive, dual elite selection mechanisms, and the inclusion of logistic chaotic single-dimensional perturbation.
Afterward, due to its very high performance, SGO is employed as the single objective optimizer in each subpopulation.
Sixteen state-of-the-art multi/many-objective optimization algorithms, two CMPMO/des based many-objective genetic algorithms named CMPMO-GA and many-objective Harris Hawks optimization named CMPMO-HHO, were extensively compared with the performance of CMPMO-SGO on 34 multi-objective and 19 many-objective benchmark problems.
The results demonstrate that CMPMO-SGO provides promising performance in addressing multi/many-objective optimization problems by utilizing the CMPMO/des framework.

This paper proposes novel variants of the shuffled particle swarm optimization (SPSO) algorithm for solving the frequency modulation sound parameter identification (FMSPI) problem.
In the SPSO framework, the population is divided into several parallel groups, and each group undergoes an independent evolutionary process using particle swarm optimization (PSO).
This study employs two distinct strategies to achieve an improved balance between the exploration and exploitation capabilities of the SPSO algorithm.
First, it introduces a group-specific strategy for the inertia weight factor parameter, which is dynamically adjusted for each group during every iteration of the SPSO algorithm.
Second, to facilitate an intensified search in promising regions of the solution space, a quasi-opposition-based strategy is incorporated into the SPSO.
Experimental results on FMSPI problems demonstrate that the proposed strategies significantly enhance the performance of the SPSO algorithm.
Also, in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed algorithm, IEEE CEC2014 test set is used and the obtained results are compared against three other shuffled algorithms include: SFL, SCE and SDE.
As evidenced the Wilcoxon signed-ranked test of reported results, the proposed algorithm demonstrates statistically superior performance versus all competitors.
This paper addresses the offline handwritten signature recognition task, a challenging classification problem due to high intra-class variability and inter-class similarity.
The objective is to accurately classify signature images into their corresponding identity classes, despite inherent uncertainty and imprecision in signature data.
To address this, a convolutional neural network is employed for feature extraction, generating a robust representation of each signature-a discriminative and noise-tolerant feature vector that captures essential structural elements of the signature.
These features are then classified using a Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network, which excels in handling overlapping and ambiguous patterns.
However, Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network’s performance is highly sensitive to its parameters (vigilance threshold and sensitivity), often requiring time-consuming manual tuning.
To overcome this limitation, an Evolution Strategy is proposed for automatic parameter optimization.
This method uses an adaptive fitness function and a dynamic mutation strategy to efficiently explore the parameter space and accelerate convergence.
The approach is validated on a proprietary offline signature dataset, and the results demonstrate that the proposed Evolution Strategy-Fuzzy Min-Max Neural Network system achieves superior accuracy, precision, and robustness compared to baseline and state-of-the-art methods.

Large-scale mechanical fault detection plays a critical role in industrial production, and neural networks have been widely adopted for this task.
However, the performance of neural networks heavily depends on the optimization of their architecture and parameters.
Traditional optimization methods such as gradient descent and particle swarm optimization can improve model performance to some extent, but they typically require adjusting all weights, which not only increases computational complexity but also often leads to redundant network structures.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a cooperative neuroevolution algorithm for constructing lightweight neural networks tailored for fault diagnosis tasks.
The algorithm introduces two co-evolving populations-one dedicated to learning the critical weights of the neural network, and the other focused on optimizing the precise weight values.
This approach enables the discovery of a sparsely connected, lightweight neural network.
By decoupling and cooperatively optimizing network structure and weights, the algorithm can more efficiently explore the search space to identify models that are both compact and high-performing.
To validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, extensive experiments are conducted on multiple industrial datasets involving large-scale mechanical fault detection.
The results demonstrate that the algorithm maintains high diagnostic accuracy while significantly reducing the number of model parameters.
Compared to conventional evolutionary algorithms, it exhibits superior model compression capability and generalization performance.
