Copula extended power aggregation operators and MEREC method under linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy information: an application to plastic waste management solution selection

The increasing global consumption of plastics has led to an alarming surge in non-biodegradable waste, posing severe threats to ecosystems and wildlife. Addressing these challenges requires advanced decision-making frameworks to navigate the complexities of competing factors and uncertainties in plastic waste management (PWM). This study presents a pioneering decision-making framework tailored to the linguistic q-rung orthopair fuzzy (\(L^{q}ROF\)) environment, offering enhanced capabilities for handling imprecision and uncertainty. A key innovation of this work is the introduction of new operational laws for\(L^{q}ROF\)values, grounded in Archimedean copula and co-copula (ACC) theory. These laws exhibit essential properties such as idempotence, boundedness, and monotonicity, forming the foundation for novel power aggregation operators (AOs), including the\(L^{q}ROF\)copula extended power average (\(L^{q}ROF\)CEPA) and geometric (\(L^{q}ROF\)CEPG) operators, along with their weighted variants. By integrating these AOs with the method based on the removal effects of criteria (MEREC) weighting technique, we propose a comprehensive decision-making approach for identifying optimal PWM strategies. The robustness and applicability of the framework are demonstrated through a detailed case study, sensitivity analysis, and comparative evaluation, highlighting its effectiveness in delivering reliable and insightful decisions for PWM challenges.
