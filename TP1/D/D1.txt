A comprehensive review of optimization approaches of district cooling systems

The integration of district cooling technology into smart energy networks powered by renewable energy sources presents significant opportunities for advancing decarbonization of the cooling sector and supporting progress towards global net-zero targets. These systems leverage advanced modelling and optimization to evaluate design configurations, operational strategies, and cross-sectoral coupling, while capturing complex thermohydraulic interactions and spatiotemporal variability. This review offers a comprehensive synthesis of methodological developments, positioning district cooling systems optimization as a distinct and emerging research domain. This study underscores past achievements, current trends, and emerging opportunities, while identifying critical research gaps and deployment challenges within optimization frameworks. By examining both design and operational phases, it offers focused insights into crucial areas shaping future development. The findings highlight the pivotal role of optimization strategies in enhancing economic, environmental, and technical performance, delivering benefits such as cost reduction, deep decarbonization through renewable integration, and improving energy efficiency. Despite notable progress, current methodologies remain limited in capturing the escalating complexity of broader system modelling, both under the emerging holistic approach and multi-domain interactions. The prevailing body of literature is largely characterized by fragmented contributions that, while demonstrating specific advancements, prove inadequate in fostering unified and scalable approaches. Advancing the field will require sustained interdisciplinary engagement, with particular emphasis on leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based metaheuristics to develop robust, scalable, and practically applicable collaborative-integrated-optimization frameworks capable of meeting the evolving challenges of sustainable district cooling technology within smart energy infrastructures and related domains.
