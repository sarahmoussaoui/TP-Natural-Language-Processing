Pythagorean fuzzy similarity measure with significance in MCDM and transportation challenges

A potent extension of intuitionistic fuzzy sets that tackles ambiguity and uncertainty at a higher level is the Pythagorean fuzzy set (\(\mathbb {P_YFS}\)). When assessing the degree of similarity between two fuzzy sets, the similarity measure is a helpful tool. It is used in typical decision-making scenarios. In this study, a new way to determining the degree of similarity is presented and contrasted with previous methods. All of the shortcomings of the existing measures can be mitigated by the newly suggested measure. The usefulness of this measure in using the modified Vlekriterijumsko KOmpromisno Rangiranje (VIKOR) approach to handle decision-making problems is illustrated with a few instances. Additionally, relevant examples are provided to illustrate how it could be used to challenges relating to transportation. The suggested method accomplishes the primary objective of the transportation problem, which is reduced transportation costs, when compared to other options.
